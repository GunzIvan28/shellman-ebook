# Preface

I was thinking about how can simplify usage of Shellman by sharing some tips that could be helpful for both using Shellman and improving shell scripting skills so liked to share them in Readme of Shellman but as you know there are some limitations thus I thought maybe a lean and simple  guide is not a bad idea for the purpose.

The hard part of *shell scripting* is not *shell scripting* itself, it is knowing the correct *command* and *switches*, so if you can do it in terminal by hand, you can do it easily via shell script. *Shell scripting* is useful for common tasks automation.

This book is a guide for beginners whom want to start shell scripting with **Shellman** effectively. If you are of pragmatic type people then go ahead and read **Basics** section and desired **namespaces** but if you are interested in *reasons behind rules*, a **Whys** section at the end of the book is added for you.

Also the business model of **Shellman** is published on [medium](https://medium.com/@remisa.yousefvand/shellman-reborn-f2cc948ce3fc).
