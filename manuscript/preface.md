# Preface

I was thinking about how can simplify usage of Shellman by sharing some tips that could be helpful for both using Shellman and improving shell scripting skills so liked to share them in Readme of Shellman but as you know there are some limitations thus I thought maybe a lean and simple  guide is not a bad idea for the purpose.
This book is useful for beginners whom want to start shell scripting with Shellman effectively.
