# Namespaces

*Shellman* divides its content into semantical categories name *namespace*. The concept is already familiar to programmers, but in simple words it means *keeping related materials together under a generic name*. So if you need to do something with `String` like changing it to `upper case` then it makes sense to look at `String` namespace and find it.

*Shellman* is structured into `namespaces`, so it is useful to know supported namespaces for ease of usage. There is no order in learning `namespaces` and you can learn them on need but before that you need to know a few things about *shell scripting*. I will try to keep this section short and simple so you can move to `namespaces` fast.
